Hey! Thank you for trying out this software and paving the way for even more translations within FoundryVTT!

## Instructions

This download package includes two things:

* The new translation files
* An updated `module.json` which includes the paths to your translations

Copy the generated translations files into where your original translations files are placed in your system / module. More specifically, the directories listed in the updated `module.json`.

Publish a new version of your system / module and you should be good to go!

## Licensing

These translations are licensed under the MIT License (included). You may use them however you wish.
